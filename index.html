            The game was originally announced in October 2019 as Project A, and League of Legends developer Riot Games
            officially announced it as Valorant a few months later. It’s somewhat of a post-postmodern game, combining
            elements of Overwatch, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and, of course, League of Legends.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) where one team attacks and the other defends. The main
            game mode, Search and Destroy, is very similar to CS:GO. The attacking team’s goal is to plant a bomb
            (called a spike) and have it detonate, while the defending team tries to avoid that. Regardless of whether
            the spike is planted or not, if a squad is wiped out before any other victory condition is met, the opposing
            squad will win.
          </p>

          <p>
            Matches are 25 rounds long, with each round lasting 100 seconds. The first team to win 13 rounds wins the
            match overall. At the beginning of the round, you’ll have 30 seconds to buy weapons and gear for that round.
            If you die in a round, you’ll have to wait until the next round to respawn. This main game mode can be
            played in either unrated or ranked matches.
          </p>

          <p>
            It sounds just like CS:GO’s Defuse game mode, but Riot has a twist on the formula. In addition to buying
            weapons, you’ll also choose an Agent at the beginning of each round. Each Agent has an ability, ranging from
            healing allies to making walls appear out of nowhere. Considering Valorant takes a MOBA-based approach to
            Agents, you’ll likely need a good spread of abilities if you want to win a match. Note, however, that you’ll
            need to buy some abilities at the beginning of a round.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since launch, Valorant has added the Spike Rush game mode. This is a quicker, best-of-seven-rounds mode
            where every attacker is equipped with a spike, and all players have the same weapon and all of their
            abilities; there is no buy round.
          </p>

          <p>

            Valorant‘s seasons will be known as Acts, each bringing new additions to the game including new Agents,
            maps, and modes.
